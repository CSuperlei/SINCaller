scSNVIndel:  Searching the potential of using Bi-LSTM neural network for single cell SNV and Indel calling.

## Introduction
Single cell sequence is popular sequencing technique in recent years.
With the emerging of single cell sequencing data, accurate calling the single cell SNV and inde 
is the focus of research. In this sudy, we propose a high precise model of calling single SNV and Indel.
The model is called scSNVIndel, which uses Bi-LSTM as base construction and integrate newly natural
language processing skill. Compared with existing tools including GATK, Monovar, DeepVarient, 
scSNVIndel achieves the best precision and speed. Through the result of scSNVIndel, we found that
scSNVIndel can call the complicated SNV and Indel, which is superior to others tools.

## Innovation
Single cell data is different form Next Generation Data.
The single cell data is sparse and the coverage is low, so it is
